	abstract={Nutrition, in sufficient amount and substance, is crucial for healthy growth and development of the skeleton and surrounding tissues, especially in physically active populations. Inadequate nutrition has been linked to maladies such as the female athlete triad, as well as poor training or competitive performance and increased risk of injury. Dietary choices favoring items high in quality protein of animal or plant origin, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fruits and vegetables high in potassium and fiber, and dairy products or other beverages fortified with calcium and vitamin D are essential to athletes to ensure adequate vitamin and mineral availability to the skeleton, which in turn can affect peak physical performance.},
