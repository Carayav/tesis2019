	abstract={Nutrition, in sufficient amount and substance, is crucial for healthy growth and development of the skeleton and surrounding tissues, especially in physically active populations. Inadequate nutrition has been linked to maladies such as the female athlete triad, as well as poor training or competitive performance and increased risk of injury. Dietary choices favoring items high in quality protein of animal or plant origin, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fruits and vegetables high in potassium and fiber, and dairy products or other beverages fortified with calcium and vitamin D are essential to athletes to ensure adequate vitamin and mineral availability to the skeleton, which in turn can affect peak physical performance.},

	abstract="There is growing recognition of the role of micro-architecture in osteoporotic bone loss and fragility. This trend has been driven by advances in imaging technology, which have enabled a transition from measures of mass to micro-architecture. Imaging trabecular bone has been a key research focus, but advances in resolution have also enabled the detection of cortical bone micro-architecture, particularly the network of vascular canals, commonly referred to as `cortical porosity.' This review aims to provide an overview of what this level of porosity is, why it is important, and how it can be characterized by imaging. Moving beyond a `trabeculocentric' view of bone loss holds the potential to improve diagnosis and monitoring of interventions. Furthermore, cortical porosity is intimately linked to the remodeling process, which underpins bone loss, and thus a larger potential exists to improve our fundamental understanding of bone health through imaging of both humans and animal models.",
