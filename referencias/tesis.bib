Inadequate nutrition has been linked to maladies such as the female athlete triad, as well as poor training or competitive performance and increased risk of injury. Dietary choices favoring items high in quality protein of animal or plant origin, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fruits and vegetables high in potassium and fiber, and dairy products or other beverages fortified with calcium and vitamin D are essential to athletes to ensure adequate vitamin and mineral availability to the skeleton, which in turn can affect peak physical performance.},

abstract = {There is growing recognition of the role of micro-architecture in osteoporotic bone loss and fragility. This trend has been driven by advances in imaging technology, which have enabled a transition from measures of mass to micro-architecture. Imaging trabecular bone has been a key research focus, but advances in resolution have also enabled the detection of cortical bone micro-architecture, particularly the network of vascular canals, commonly referred to as 'cortical porosity.' This review aims to provide an overview of what this level of porosity is, why it is important, and how it can be characterized by imaging. Moving beyond a 'trabeculocentric' view of bone loss holds the potential to improve diagnosis and monitoring of interventions. Furthermore, cortical porosity is intimately linked to the remodeling process, which underpins bone loss, and thus a larger potential exists to improve our fundamental understanding of bone health through imaging of both humans and animal models.},

abstract = {Understanding the basic physics of ultrasound is essential for acute care physicians. Medical ultrasound machines generate and receive ultrasound waves. Brightness mode (B mode) is the basic mode that is usually used. Ultrasound waves are emitted from piezoelectric crystals of the ultrasound transducer. Depending on the acoustic impedance of different materials, which depends on their density, different grades of white and black images are produced. There are different methods that can control the quality of ultrasound waves including timing of ultrasound wave emission, frequency of waves, and size and curvature of the surface of the transducer. The received ultrasound signal can be amplified by increasing the gain. The operator should know sonographic artifacts which may distort the studied structures or even show unreal ones. The most common artifacts include shadow and enhancement artifacts, edge artifact, mirror artifact and reverberation artifact.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Design processes such as human-centered design, which involve the end user throughout the product development and testing process, can be crucial in ensuring that the product meets the needs and capabilities of the user, particularly in terms of safety and user experience. The structured and iterative nature of human-centered design can often present a challenge when design teams are faced with the necessary, rapid, product development life cycles associated with the competitive connected health industry. OBJECTIVE We wanted to derive a structured methodology that followed the principles of human-centered design that would allow designers and developers to ensure that the needs of the user are taken into account throughout the design process, while maintaining a rapid pace of development. In this paper, we present the methodology and its rationale before outlining how it was applied to assess and enhance the usability, human factors, and user experience of a connected health system known as the Wireless Insole for Independent and Safe Elderly Living (WIISEL) system, a system designed to continuously assess fall risk by measuring gait and balance parameters associated with fall risk. METHODS We derived a three-phase methodology. In Phase 1 we emphasized the construction of a use case document. This document can be used to detail the context of use of the system by utilizing storyboarding, paper prototypes, and mock-ups in conjunction with user interviews to gather insightful user feedback on different proposed concepts. In Phase 2 we emphasized the use of expert usability inspections such as heuristic evaluations and cognitive walkthroughs with small multidisciplinary groups to review the prototypes born out of the Phase 1 feedback. Finally, in Phase 3 we emphasized classical user testing with target end users, using various metrics to measure the user experience and improve the final prototypes. RESULTS We report a successful implementation of the methodology for the design and development of a system for detecting and predicting falls in older adults. We describe in detail what testing and evaluation activities we carried out to effectively test the system and overcome usability and human factors problems. CONCLUSIONS We feel this methodology can be applied to a wide variety of connected health devices and systems. We consider this a methodology that can be scaled to different-sized projects accordingly.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Trabecular bone loss and vertebral fractures are historical hallmarks of osteoporosis. During the past 70 years, this view has dominated research aiming to understand the structural basis of bone fragility. We suggest this notion needs to be revised to recognize and include the role of cortical bone deterioration as an important determinant of bone strength throughout life. RECENT FINDINGS About 80% of the fragility fractures involve the appendicular skeleton, at regions comprising large amounts of cortical bone. Up to 70% of the age-related bone loss at these locations is the result of intracortical remodeling that cavitates cortical bone producing porosity. It is now possible to accurately quantify cortical porosity in vivo and use this information to understand the pathogenesis of bone fragility throughout life, assist in identifying patients at risk for fracture, and use this as a potential marker to monitor the effects of treatment on bone structure and strength. SUMMARY Cortical bone has an important role in determining bone strength. The loss of strength is the result of intracortical and endocortical remodeling imbalance that produces cortical porosity and thinning. Studies are needed to determine whether porosity is an independent predictor of fracture risk and whether a reduction in porosity serves as a surrogate of antifracture efficacy.},

abstract = {The complexity of matrix multiplication (hereafter MM) has been intensively studied since 1969, when Strassen surprisingly decreased the exponent 3 in the cubic cost of the straightforward classical MM to log 2 (7) $\approx$ 2.8074. Applications to some fundamental problems of Linear Algebra and Computer Science have been immediately recognized, but the researchers in Computer Algebra keep discovering more and more applications even today, with no sign of slowdown. We survey the unfinished history of decreasing the exponent towards its information lower bound 2, recall some important techniques discovered in this process and linked to other fields of computing, reveal sample surprising applications to fast computation of the inner products of two vectors and summation of integers, and discuss the curse of recursion, which separates the progress in fast MM into its most acclaimed and purely theoretical part and into valuable acceleration of MM of feasible sizes. Then, in the second part of our paper, we cover fast MM in realistic symbolic computations and discuss applications and implementation of fast exact matrix multiplication. We first review how most of exact linear algebra can be reduced to matrix multiplication over small finite fields. Then we highlight the differences in the design of approximate and exact implementations of fast MM, taking into account nowadays processor and memory hierarchies. In the concluding section we comment on current perspectives of the study of fast MM.},

abstract = {Existing ultrasound devices for assessing the human tibia are based on detecting the first arriving signal, corresponding to a wave propagating at, or close to, the bulk longitudinal velocity in bone. However, human long bones are effectively irregular hollow tubes and should theoretically support the propagation of more complex guided modes similar to Lamb waves in plates. Guided waves are attractive because they propagate throughout the bone thickness and can potentially yield more information on bone material properties and architecture. In this study, Lamb wave theory and numerical simulations of wave propagation were used to gain insights into the expected behaviour of guided waves in bone. Experimental measurements in acrylic plates, using a prototype low-frequency axial pulse transmission device, confirmed the presence of two distinct propagating waves: the first arriving wave propagating at, or close to, the longitudinal velocity, and a slower second wave whose behaviour was consistent with the lowest order Lamb antisymmetrical (A0) mode. In a pilot study of healthy and osteoporotic subjects, the velocity of the second wave differed significantly between the two groups, whereas the first arriving wave velocity did not, suggesting the former to be a more sensitive indicator of osteoporosis. We conclude that guided wave measurements may offer an enhanced approach to the ultrasonic characterization of long bones.},

@article{Kohrs2016,
abstract = {The temporal contingency of feedback is an essential requirement of successful human-computer interactions. The timing of feedback not only affects the behavior of a user but is also accompanied by changes in psychophysiology and neural activity. In three fMRI experiments we systematically studied the impact of delayed feedback on brain activity while subjects performed an auditory categorization task. In the first fMRI experiment, we analyzed the effects of rare and thus unexpected delays of different delay duration on brain activity. In the second experiment, we investigated if users can adapt to frequent delays. Therefore, delays were presented as often as immediate feedback. In a third experiment, the influence of interaction outage was analyzed by measuring the effect of infrequent omissions of feedback on brain activity. The results show that unexpected delays in feedback presentation compared to immediate feedback stronger activate inter alia bilateral the anterior insular cortex, the posterior medial frontal cortex, the left inferior parietal lobule and the right inferior frontal junction. The strength of this activation increases with the duration of the delay. Thus, delays interrupt the course of an interaction and trigger an orienting response that in turn activates brain regions of action control. If delays occur frequently, users can adapt, delays become expectable, and the brain activity in the observed network diminishes over the course of the interaction. However, introducing rare omissions of expected feedback reduces the system's trustworthiness which leads to an increase in brain activity not only in response to such omissions but also following frequently occurring and thus expected delays.},

@article{Minonzio2018a,
abstract = {Several studies showed the ability of the cortex of long bones such as the radius and tibia to guide mechanical waves. Such experimental evidence has given rise to the emergence of a category of quantitative ultrasound techniques, referred to as the axial transmission, specifically developed to measure the propagation of ultrasound guided waves in the cortical shell along the axis of long bones. An ultrasound axial transmission technique, with an automated approach to quantify cortical thickness and porosity is described. The guided modes propagating in the cortex are recorded with a 1-MHz custom made linear transducer array. Measurement of the dispersion curves is achieved using a two-dimensional spatio-temporal Fourier transform combined with singular value decomposition. Automatic parameters identification is obtained through the solution of an inverse problem in which the dispersion curves are predicted with a two-dimensional transverse isotropic free plate model. Thirty-one radii and fifteen tibiae harvested from human cadavers underwent axial transmission measurements. Estimates of cortical thickness and porosity were obtained on 40 samples out of 46. The reproducibility, given by the root mean square error of the standard deviation of estimates, was 0.11 mm for thickness and 1.9% for porosity. To assess accuracy, site-matched micro-computed tomography images of the bone specimens imaged at 9 $\mu$m voxel size served as the gold standard. Agreement between micro-computed tomography and axial transmission for quantification of thickness and porosity at the radius and tibia ranged from R2=0.63 for porosity (root mean square error RMSE=1.8%) to 0.89 for thickness (RMSE=0.3 mm). Despite an overall good agreement for porosity, the method performs less well for porosities lower than 10%. The heterogeneity and general complexity of cortical bone structure, which are not fully accounted for by our model, are suspected to weaken the model approximation. This study presents the first validation study for assessing cortical thickness and porosity using the axial transmission technique. The automatic signal processing minimizes operator-dependent errors for parameters determination. Recovering the waveguide characteristics, that is to say cortical thickness and porosity, could provide reliable information about skeletal status and future fracture risk.},

@article{Dinamarca-Montecinos2015,
abstract = {Background: Hip fractures (HFx) are an important geriatric syndrome, with a high incidence in developing countries. Aim: To describe characteristics of a group of Chilean patients with HFx. Patients and Methods: In a cross-sectional study we included patients aged 60 years or more with a HF admitted to an or- thopedic service along three years. Age, incidence, location, seasonality, hospital stay, time between HFx and surgery, mortality, prior treatment for osteoporosis, anatomical location, etiology and type of surgery were evaluated. Results: We reviewed 647 patients with a median age of 81 years (76% women). The cal- culated incidence of hip fracture for people aged ≥ 65 years was 177/100,000. Sixty six percent of fractures were extracapsular. Mean hospital stay was 17 days and the mean lapse between the fracture and surgery was 19 days. Eighty four percent of patients had osteoporosis and only 5% were receiving treatment. Eighty three percent of patients were operated. Osteosynthesis was mainly used for extracapsular fractures and arthroplasty for intracapsular lesions. Intracapsular HFx tended to occur more commonly during warm seasons (Odds ratio = 1.534). Mortality at one year was 24%. It was higher among non-operated patients in whom the proportion of males and number of comorbidities were significantly higher. Conclusions: A high proportion of patients with HFx have osteoporosis albeit a reduced number is receiving treatment. Non-operated patients had a higher risk profile and higher mortality.},
