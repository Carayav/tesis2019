Fonction ouverture AZA_5
[SIG2,fe,f0,data,temps, RSS, RSB] = ouverture_aza_v5(start_path,chemin1,indice,unite,porte)%,Nfft_t,fmin,fmax)

Function to open on matlab the .conf and .us files obtained
From the acquisitions by the probe aza_v5


Function input
start_path = relative path of the measurements folder from the codes folder
matlab
path1 = absolute path of the folder that contains the .us and .conf measures
index = number of .us, if 0 all .us
unit == 0 in mV, unit == 1 in sampling level
gate == 1 application of a TuckeyWin window on time signals

Output of the function
SIG2 = Matrix of size Nt x nb_receptor x nb_emission x index x direction
fe = freq ech (20 MHz for AZA)
f0 = Central frequency
data = structure of the general parameters of the acquisitions
time = time vector associated with acquired signals
RSS report signal   saturation (2048) nb_receptor x nb_emission x index x direction
RSB signal ratio   noise (2048) nb_receptor x nb_emission x index x direction
