abstract = {"Covering the basics of X-rays, CT, PET, nuclear medicine, ultrasound and MRI, this textbook provides senior undergraduate and beginning graduate students with a broad introduction to medical imaging. Over 130 end-of-chapter exercises are included, in addition to solved example problems, which enable students to master the theory as well as providing them with the tools needed to solve more difficult problems. The basic theory, instrumentation and state-of-the-art techniques and applications are covered, bringing students immediately up to date with recent developments, such as combined computed tomography/positron emission tomography, multi-slice CT, four-dimensional ultrasound and parallel imaging MR technology. Clinical examples provide practical applications of physics and engineering knowledge to medicine. Finally, helpful references to specialized texts, recent review articles and relevant scientific journals are provided at the end of each chapter, making this an ideal textbook for a one-semester course in medical imaging"--Provided by publisher.},

abstract = {There is growing recognition of the role of micro-architecture in osteoporotic bone loss and fragility. This trend has been driven by advances in imaging technology, which have enabled a transition from measures of mass to micro-architecture. Imaging trabecular bone has been a key research focus, but advances in resolution have also enabled the detection of cortical bone micro-architecture, particularly the network of vascular canals, commonly referred to as 'cortical porosity.' This review aims to provide an overview of what this level of porosity is, why it is important, and how it can be characterized by imaging. Moving beyond a 'trabeculocentric' view of bone loss holds the potential to improve diagnosis and monitoring of interventions. Furthermore, cortical porosity is intimately linked to the remodeling process, which underpins bone loss, and thus a larger potential exists to improve our fundamental understanding of bone health through imaging of both humans and animal models.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Trabecular bone loss and vertebral fractures are historical hallmarks of osteoporosis. During the past 70 years, this view has dominated research aiming to understand the structural basis of bone fragility. We suggest this notion needs to be revised to recognize and include the role of cortical bone deterioration as an important determinant of bone strength throughout life. RECENT FINDINGS About 80% of the fragility fractures involve the appendicular skeleton, at regions comprising large amounts of cortical bone. Up to 70% of the age-related bone loss at these locations is the result of intracortical remodeling that cavitates cortical bone producing porosity. It is now possible to accurately quantify cortical porosity in vivo and use this information to understand the pathogenesis of bone fragility throughout life, assist in identifying patients at risk for fracture, and use this as a potential marker to monitor the effects of treatment on bone structure and strength. SUMMARY Cortical bone has an important role in determining bone strength. The loss of strength is the result of intracortical and endocortical remodeling imbalance that produces cortical porosity and thinning. Studies are needed to determine whether porosity is an independent predictor of fracture risk and whether a reduction in porosity serves as a surrogate of antifracture efficacy.},

@article{Dinamarca-Montecinos2015,
abstract = {Background: Hip fractures (HFx) are an important geriatric syndrome, with a high incidence in developing countries. Aim: To describe characteristics of a group of Chilean patients with HFx. Patients and Methods: In a cross-sectional study we included patients aged 60 years or more with a HF admitted to an or- thopedic service along three years. Age, incidence, location, seasonality, hospital stay, time between HFx and surgery, mortality, prior treatment for osteoporosis, anatomical location, etiology and type of surgery were evaluated. Results: We reviewed 647 patients with a median age of 81 years (76% women). The cal- culated incidence of hip fracture for people aged â‰¥ 65 years was 177/100,000. Sixty six percent of fractures were extracapsular. Mean hospital stay was 17 days and the mean lapse between the fracture and surgery was 19 days. Eighty four percent of patients had osteoporosis and only 5% were receiving treatment. Eighty three percent of patients were operated. Osteosynthesis was mainly used for extracapsular fractures and arthroplasty for intracapsular lesions. Intracapsular HFx tended to occur more commonly during warm seasons (Odds ratio = 1.534). Mortality at one year was 24%. It was higher among non-operated patients in whom the proportion of males and number of comorbidities were significantly higher. Conclusions: A high proportion of patients with HFx have osteoporosis albeit a reduced number is receiving treatment. Non-operated patients had a higher risk profile and higher mortality.},
